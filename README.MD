This is an example code for using autogen Library with file content retrieving and function calling for Night of Chances 2024 GenAI  workshop attendees.
The example also shows how to use the GenAI as voice assistant.
The code was previously  intended as notes for creation new code at the workshop, so it’s not optimized.
You need API key for running this code, insert the API key to the LLM_ConfigList.json file.
Please feel free to experiment with the code and find the right balance between right AI model, prompting and human input mode “NEVER, ALWAYS, TERMINATE”

GOOD LUCK!
